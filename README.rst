Parser for multipart/form-data
==============================

This module provides a parser for the multipart/form-data format. It can read
from a file, a socket or a WSGI environment. The parser can be used to replace
cgi.FieldStorage (without the bugs) and works with Python 2.5+ and 3.x (2to3).

Features
--------

* Python 2.5+ and 3.x (2to3) support. No dependencies.
* Parses multipart/form-data and application/x-url-encoded.
* Produces useful error messages in 'strict'-mode.
* Uploads of unknown size (missing Content-Length header).
* Fast memory mapped files (io.BytesIO) for small uploads.
* Temporary files on disk for big uploads.
* Memory and disk resource limits to prevent DOS attacks.
* 100% test coverage.

Compared to cgi.FieldStorage()
------------------------------

* Reads directly from a socket (no ``.readline(n)``, just ``.read(n)``).
* Consumes bytes regardless of Python version.
* Is desgined for WSGI, not CGI.
* Is not broken.

Limitations
-----------

* Nested "multipart/mixed" parts are not supported;
  they are mentioned in RFC 2388, section 4.2 and deprecated (for clients) since RFC 7578, section 4.3.

* The "encoded-word" method (described in RFC 2047) is not supported.

* The MIME headers are expected to be encoded in the charset given to the ``Multipart``/``MultipartParser`` constructor. [For operability considerations, see RFC 7578, section 5.1.]

* The size of headers are not counted against the in-memory limit.

Todo
----

* Support for base64 and quoted-printable transfer encoding.
